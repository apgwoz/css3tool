What is it?
-----------

A tool for optimizing your CSS3 code, written in Python.  For instance,
you can feed it a CSS3 file and a HTML5 file and css3tool will tell you
which selectors aren't being used.

Installation
------------

css3tool requires Python (some version) and lxml.

    pip install lxml
    git clone <project>

Usage
-----

I don't know yet.  Maybe:

    ./css3tool.py --unused <css file> <html file>

Contributing
------------

For the love of God, yes.
